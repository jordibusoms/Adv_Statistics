In your laboratory they were following the diet of a single person and making metabolomics
of biological samples extracted to this person at a fixed time post eating (the file with the
data you will find it in my github). They propose the following model (very simple) model:

ATP = a * Proteins + b * Carbohydrates + c * Fats + Îµ

They ask you to find the best possible values from **a, b** and **c** , and say which is the extent of
error that this model have.

**Important:** You can only use pandas and plotting libraries.
