# Generala probabilities

Generala is a dice game where players take turns rolling five dice. After each roll, the player
chooses which dice (if any) to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the
dice up to three times on a turn. ​ The following combinations earn points:

+ *Ones*, *Twos*, *Threes*, *Fours*, *Fives* or *Sixes*. A player may add the numbers on any combination of dice showing the same number. For example, 4-4-4-2-6 would score 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 points in "Fours" or 2 points in "Twos" or even 6 points in "Sixes". Once a player has taken points on a specific combination, he or she may not take points for that combination again during the game.
+ *Straight*. 20 points. A straight is a combination of five consecutive numbers (1-2-3-4-5, or 2-3-4-5-6); it also includes consecutive numbers with ​ 6 ​ and ​ 1 ​ , such as 3-4-5-6-1. In essence, any set of five unmatched dice are a straight
+ *Full*. 30 points. Any set of three combined with a set of two. For example, 5-5-5-3-3.
+ *Poker*. 40 points. Four dice with the same number. For example, 2-2-2-2-6.
+ *Generala*. 50 or 60 points. All five dice with the same number.
When you get one of these combinations in a single roll, its say that is *served* and you get five extra points.
